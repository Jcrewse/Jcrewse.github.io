# Saying a lot about looking

Consider the following, rather unintuitive sequence...

$$
 L = 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, 31131211131221, ...
$$

How would you go about determining the rule of this sequence? Often times, in determining such rules for sequence problems one would start by considering the additive or multiplicative relationships between each member of the sequence. Are they whole number multiples of each other? Fractional multiples? For example, the sequence of even numbers
$$
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..
$$  
can be expressed by the simple additive rule
$$
\sum_n 2n.
$$
And a multiplicative sequence
$$
1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, ...
$$
has a rule that can be written
$$
\sum_n (2n)^2. 
$$
But can you come up with an additive or multiplicative rule for the sequence $L$?

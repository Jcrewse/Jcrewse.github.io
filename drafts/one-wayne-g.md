"One Wayne G" is easily one of the most interesting musical releases I've heard in years, but for a somewhat unusual reason.

It is not the most catchy. It is not the most technical. It is not even the most musically engaging album. It is not even really an album. None of typical criteria are what makes this release interesting. 

"One Wayne G" is Mac DeMarco's musical diary. 

The pretense for the record was a bit somber, with Mac alluding to his retirement from music creation. As much as I hope that he is simply in a musical slump that he will overcome, the release of his entire collection of demos from the past five years feels a bit like a grandparent telling you what heirlooms you can have once they've passed. As if saying "I won't have use for these anymore." 

Despite "One Wayne G" seemingly marking Mac's retirement, the collection has sparked my interest in the months since it's release due to it's deeply personal look at Mac's creation process.

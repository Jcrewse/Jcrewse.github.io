2022 was an eventful year! My wife Shay and I started the year living in just outside of Kansas City and ended the year living just outside of Chicago. We started the year as newlyweds on our honeymoon and ended it as parents to our beautiful boy, Maxwell. I started the year as a burnt out Ph.D. student and ended it as a postdoctoral appointee at Argonne National Laboratory. Transitions are stressful, but certainly memorable and usually worth it. 

### Honeymoon in Mexico
The year started out with quite a bang as Shay and I travelled to Mexico in early January for our honeymoon: an all-inclusive stay at the Valentina Imperial Riviera Maya! Despite missing our first day due to a surge in flight cancellations and having to overcome the tragic mistake of a forgotten payment method, we had one of the most fantastic times of our lives. Our gluttony was on full display for our six-day stay as we ate and drank our way through their entire offering of restaurants, bars and caf√©s. Between our meals, we spent our time sprawled out under cabanas on the warm beaches and watching the nightly showing of dancers, magicians and musicians. Shay and I knew the year ahead of us was going to be trying and such a special, luxurious start to it was incredibly refreshing. 

### Shay Is Pregnant!
2022 began to really get interesting in May when we found out that Shay was pregnant! Something which we had long been concerned would not come easily. We were glad to be wrong here. At first, the news was a bit overwhelming as I had only recently begun to get serious about my job search, I was focusing heavily on my Ph.D. dissertation, and we were facing down the prospect of having to live a few months in my parent's basement. Fortunately, the solutions for each of these concerns started to materialize and the idea of becoming a father grew more and more exciting by the day. Both my family and Shay's went above and beyond with their support, gifts, baby showers and gender reveals. Maxwell was definitely set up to enter the world surrounded by love. 

### Living At Home
Due to a short lease at our apartment as a result of the awkward timings of any transitional period, Shay and I ended up living out every adult's dream... We moved into my parent's basement! Despite my sarcastic implications of dread for this living situation, I love my parents and really enjoyed being able to spend time with them. Of course, had we lived there longer than the short six weeks we did, my opinion of the situation may have differed. However, I had already accepted my position at Argonne and was able to make big steps in completing my dissertation, all while enjoying the summer evenings in the wonderful backyard. 

### Moving to Oak Park
Location was a major criterion in my job search, so I was very excited when I got the offer at Argonne and would have the opportunity to move to the Chicago area. I had lived in Missouri all of my life, and I was ready to experience something new and closer to city life. Although Argonne is in the Chicago area, it is still in the suburbs, so Shay and I worked hard to strike the right balance between city amenities and commute times. Oak Park ended up striking this balance perfectly. The apartment we found includes nearly direct access to the Blue Line, a grocery store in the 'backyard', and a very relaxed and welcoming neighborhood. 

### Starting at Argonne National Laboratory
Working in the national lab system has long been a top career goal for me, so when I was offered a postdoctoral position at the Center for Nanoscale Materials, I was elated! As far as postdocs go, national labs are top tier in their academics and their compensation. I couldn't have asked for a better opportunity. I joined the [Theory and Modeling Group](https://www.anl.gov/cnm/theory-and-modeling) working with Pierre Darancet on understanding the optical properties of helical materials using the myriad of high-performance computational resources of Argonne. My appointment began in the last week of August and the first four months were certainly a test. The transition in workload, research topic, and work place dynamics took some getting used to, causing my imposter syndrome to flare up to a new high, but in the final weeks of the year I had begun to gain a little more confidence. With such a stressful start to a new job, I was thrilled that they offered a wonderful six weeks off for parental leave. 

### Maxwell is born!
My son, Maxwell Linux Crewse, was born Wednesday, December 28th, 2022 at 7:30pm in McNeal Hospital in Berwyn, Illinois! His birth was planned. An elective induction due to inconvenient insurance changes. Having arrived at the hospital for her planned induction at 6am the previous day, the entire labor process amounted to nearly 36 hours.

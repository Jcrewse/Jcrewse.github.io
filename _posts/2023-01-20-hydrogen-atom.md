For a theory often cited as the most accurately confirmed theory in human history, it is rather intriguing that quantum mechanics has a relatively small number of [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum-mechanical_systems_with_analytical_solutions) for which *exact* analytical solutions have been found. Luckily for us humans, one of those systems is the atom that comprises more than 70% of the entire universe. Hydrogen.
